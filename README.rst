About
-----

This software provides basic CLI and API functionality for controlling a single
fan and reading sensor values from the AC Infinity Controller 69 Pro using bluetooth. 

Install
-------

::

    pip install acinf

This script was authored for python 3.10 and Linux, but other python versions and operating
systems may work.

Usage
-----

If everything is installed correctly, command ``acinf`` should have the following output::

    $ acinf
    usage: acinf [-h] [--log-level {debug,info,warning,error}] mac_address {get,set} [value]
    acinf: error: the following arguments are required: mac_address, action

To set fan level to 5 use command for example `MAC address`_ DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE::

    acinf DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE set 5

To show all values to stdout in json format::

    $ acinf DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE get
    {
        "temperature_c": 18.56,
        "temperature_f": 65.408,
        "humidity": 70.03,
        "vpd_kpa": 0.61
    }

To retrieve just a single value as ASCII float to stdout, combine `get` with any
of the following values *temperature_c*, *temperature_f*, *humidity*,
*vpd_kpa*::

    $ acinf DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE get temperature_f
    65.408

MAC address
-----------

To determine the MAC address of your AC Infinity controller on Linux, ensure the
bluetooth package is installed and execute `bluetoothctl`, then, command `scan on`,
examine devices marked 'NEW', or, enter command `devices`.

AC infinity controllers are marked 'ACI-E', as in the example below::

    linux# bluetoothctl
    Agent registered
    [CHG] Controller 00:11:22:33:44:66 Pairable: yes
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    Discovery started
    [CHG] Controller 00:11:22:33:44:66 Discovering: yes
    [NEW] Device AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF AB-CD-EF-AB-CD-EF
    [NEW] Device DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE ACI-E
    [NEW] Device AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:FF AB-CD-EF-AB-CD-FF

Pairing
-------

If you haven't previously paired with your device, do that now. Press and Hold
the bluetooth button on the controller until it begins flashing, then,
enter bluetoothctl command, `pair DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE`.

Caveats
-------

- Although 4 fans may be connected to the controller, this software only supports
  controlling a single fan.
- Do not execute more than 1 of these processes at a time. All 'get' and 'set' commands
  are failed if they exceed 1 minute, and so any scheduled execution of this command
  should be limited to approximately once per 2 minutes.
- This API and software has a very slow startup time, because it reconnects
  to the bluetooth device each time. Although it is possible to re-use a connection,
  I found persistent connections to be unreliable over long durations.
- Errors may often report to stderr, about timeout or failure to discover or connect,
  especially for long receiver distances, but all get or set operations are
  automatically retried for a full minute before failure.
